The contents of the talk included a PPG introduction, data analysis, an introduction to global infrastructure and 
an SAP introduction that are extremely useful for me as a computer science student.

Through this talk I have a more understanding about data analytics plays a crucial role in transforming 
sources of data into meaningful insights for making decisions. Besides, I also learned how IT infrastructure
